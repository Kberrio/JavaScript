synchronous -> tasks happen one by one
I cannot go do another task until the previous one has been completed.

For example:
I give you the following instruction:
You are sitting in a table.
In this table, there are 10 rocks, scattered all throughout the table.
You have been tasked to organize the rocks in a straight line, but you can only do this by grabbing one rock at a time.
You pick up one rock, then set it to where you want your line of rocks to be. But you can only do this, rock by rock, until you have finally organized every rock in one line. 

This explains what something synchronous is.
